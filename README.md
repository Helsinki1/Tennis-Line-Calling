The goal of this project is to create a tool that tracks the trajectory, bounce, and speed of a player's serve with reference to the tennis court

Remaining Objectives:
1. Test the current bounce detection algo
2. Develop a UI to make the pgm more accessible
3. Group the detected ball trajectory coords into five lists, one for each serve (assume 5 serves are made)
4. Present on r/tennis, r/pythonprojects, r/python, r/opencv, r/computervision
